    "This Jupyter tutorial provides an overview of the RESOLVE and ECO 21cm data, including new restructuring of our database variables that will become available in ECO DR3 and RESOLVE DR4. The REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) survey contains a highly-complete atomic gas census published in Stark et al. (2016). The Environmental COntext (ECO) catalog surrounds the A-semester of RESOLVE in a 10x larger volume, composed primarily of reprocessed archival data including HI data from RESOLVE and ALFALFA. For more details on the surveys and the 21 cm data, please visit https://resolve.astro.unc.edu/.\n",

    "**NOTE**: To complete this tutorial, you will need a private, team-only version of the ECO catalog. To obtain this dataset, please log onto https://resolve-g3.slack.com, or obtain a team-only catalog from https://resolve.astro.unc.edu.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many galaxies in the RESOLVE and ECO databases which are not part of the official survey, for example because they are fainter than the luminosity completeness floor, or because they have redshifts outside of the official volume. For this tutorial, we will use the original luminosity-complete and volume-limited selection. For details on this selection and other possible samples, see the RESOLVE Data Tutorial (https://github.com/resolvesurvey/database-tutorial). ECO has recently been updated with a fresh crossmatch from SDSS DR7/DR8 for improved redshifts, as well as harmonization of r-band magnitudes with RESOLVE. \n",
    "\n",
    "The new version of ECO also contains additional selection criteria based on new classifications of duplicate entries. Non-duplicates may be selected with the `dup` flag with criterion `dup<=0`. Database entries for which `dup>0` represent carbon-copy targets or, for example, entries that represent a second, off-center image of a galaxy. The value `dup=0` represents entries that haven't been manually inspected for duplicate status, and thus we have no motivation to exclude them from the official survey. Please see the full key for additional details (https://users.castle.unc.edu/~zhutchen/dupkey.txt)."

    "The RESOLVE survey contains a complete atomic gas census sourced from the ALFALFA survey and deep observations with Arecibo and the Green Bank Telescope (see Stark et al., 2016). The main HI-related data columns are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `mhidet`: HI masses for 21cm detections assuming H0 = 70 (km/s)/Mpc\n",
    "- `emhidet`: Statistical uncertainty on HI masses for 21cm detections\n",
    "- `mhilim`: Upper limit HI masses for 21cm non-detections assuming H0 = 70 (km/s)/Mpc ($3\\sigma$ limits for RESOLVE, see note below for ECO)\n",
    "- `limflag`: 1/0 flag indicating upper limit status; 0 if detection or unobserved; `limflag = (mhilim>0)`\n",
    "- `confused`: flag indicating confusion in the `mhidet` column\n",
    "- `w50`: peak HI linewidth at 50% level in km/s\n",
    "- `w20`: peak HI linewidth at 20% level in km/s\n",
    "- `peaksnhi`: peak SNR of 21 cm line; ideally prefer SNR > 5-6 for a reliable linewidth\n",
    "- `logmgas`: best estimate of gas content utilizing detections & strong upper limits, while estimating for weak limits and badly confused observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RESOLVE and ECO wiki sites contain a full glossary of all variables. You may wish to contrast these with the naming conventions used in the public RESOLVE DR3. While the actual HI data has not changed for RESOLVE, the columns have been restructured, and older conventions are now deprecated (e.g., `mhi` is now deprecated to `mhidep`). \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, ECO has recently seen a complete overhaul of its HI inventory, based on a new crossmatch with ALFALFA-100 ($\\alpha$100, Haynes et al., 2018). This crossmatch has added **~5,000 detections or upper limits** to ECO beyond what was available from $\\alpha$40 and RESOLVE-A. For ECO, naming conventions match RESOLVE, such as in the list above. However, for ECO, non-detections are compiled heterogeneously, so we compute upper limit masses as `mhilim = limmult*limsigma`, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `limsigma`: 21 cm mass noise for non-detections, Ïƒ_M, based on estimated RMS noise and estimated W20 linewidth. 0 for detections. \n",
    "- `limmult`: Scalar multiplier, X, by which to scale an upper limit mass (mhilim) from `limsigma`. We use a value of X=3 within the RESOLVE-A region, where HI spectra were extracted with the optical position known as a prior. Outside RESOLVE-A, we use X=5 to characterize upper limit masses for what would have been a blind detection.\n",
